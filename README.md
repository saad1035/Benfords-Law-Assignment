# Benfords-Law-Assignment

Welcome to the Benfords Law Analysis! The place where you load your sales file, then we display the analysis of frequency of first digits in a numerical and graphical display. Finally, the results gets written in a table format in a CSV File if you wish to.

The program starts by asking the user to import a sales file containing postal codes and sales for each postal code. Upon reading the file and ensuring that it works, the user has the option of generating a bar graph or generating results in a csv file. When the user generates a bar graph, it creates a JPEG image with the bar graph. The information of the bar graph is retrieved through a set of algorithms used by Benfords Law. This information displays the analysis of frequency of first digits. On the other hand, the user also has the option of generating such information in a CSV file, where it displays the analysis of frequency of first digits in a numerica display.
